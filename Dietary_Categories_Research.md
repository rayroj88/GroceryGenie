# Dietary Categories Research\
\
## Purpose\
\
The purpose of this document is to outline various dietary categories to be implemented in the GroceryGenie application. This will serve as a reference for database updates and UI design.\
\
## Categories\
\
Below is a list of dietary categories, their definitions, and any specific criteria that define them:\
\
### Vegan\
- **Definition**: A diet that excludes all animal products.\
- **Criteria**:\
  - No meat, dairy, eggs, or other animal-derived substances.\
  - May include plant-based alternatives.\
\
### Vegetarian\
- **Definition**: A diet that excludes meat.\
- **Criteria**:\
  - No meat or fish.\
  - Dairy and eggs may be included.\
\
### Gluten-Free\
- **Definition**: A diet excluding gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye.\
- **Criteria**:\
  - No wheat, barley, rye, or cross-contaminated oats.\
  - Products must be certified gluten-free if possible.\
\
### Organic\
- **Definition**: Foods produced without synthetic pesticides, genetic modification, or irradiation.\
- **Criteria**:\
  - Must meet government standards for organic certification.\
\
### Keto\

## Challenges and Considerations\
\
- **Labeling Accuracy**: Ensuring the products are accurately labeled according to their categories.\
- **Cross-Contamination**: Addressing concerns of cross-contamination, particularly for gluten-free and allergy-specific categories.\
- **Certification Verification**: Verifying organic and other certifications where applicable.\
\
## Conclusion\
\
This research will be used to update the product database with appropriate tags and to design the UI for dietary filters. It is imperative for the GroceryGenie application to provide accurate and reliable dietary filtering to meet the needs of all users.\
