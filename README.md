# Sprint 2 next steps: 

- Fully implement the shopping list with the databse rather than javascript.

- Polish css for even styling across all pages.

- Finish button functionality on the header and footer.

- Implement deitary information functionality.

- Add feature to suggest items based on previous user activity.

# Retrospective: Changelings

### What went well:
- We achieved the goal of building the core functionality for the app.

- We did work pretty evenly throughout the sprint resulting in a good looking burnup chart.

- We communicated and helped eachother we difficulties relating to both the project and gitkraken etc.

### What can each teamember do better:
- Danny: I could've done a better job about communicating what needs to be done and delegating tasks.
- Gerardo: I need to get better at using Gitkraken. Also need to finish my tasks quicker so i can work on bugs.

### What might be impeding us from performing better:
- Gitkraken proper usage. making sure we all know how to use it correctly and merge all of our code to main.

- Better idea of how the UI needs to look.

- More knowledge of how the database will interact with our app and how to implement the more advanced features planned for our project.
