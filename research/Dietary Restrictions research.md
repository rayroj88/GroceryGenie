# Dietary Restriction Research
## Vegetarian Diet
- **Description**: A vegetarian diet is a well-known option that people have adopted for decades, whether by choice or due to lack of access to meat. In recent years, the percentage of vegetarians in the U.S. has grown to 10.61%. The odds of serving a vegetarian guest are relatively high, so it’s essential to understand their dietary restrictions. Vegetarians follow one simple rule — they don’t eat any meat products, including:
Beef
Pork
Chicken
Seafood
This dietary restriction includes any meat byproducts like bone broth, gelatin and lard. However, they can enjoy meatless options like black bean burgers and veggie sausage. This diet doesn’t prevent them from enjoying products from living animals, such as eggs and milk.

## Pescetarian Diet
- **Description**: The pescetarian diet follows the same rules as the vegetarian diet, with the exception of fish. Pescetarians can eat fish, shrimp, crab, oysters and any other seafood. An estimated 5.82% of the population follows a pescatarian diet.
